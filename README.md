Recipe Cost Calculator

I updated my styling to make everthing look better. I removed the ingredients part of the form. Now you just enter the recipe name, cost, and servings. The program calculates the cost per serving and displays it along 
with the other info in a table. The table is linked to mongodb and you can edit and delete recipes from it. I spent to many hours trying to figure out nextauth and I decided to take to 7 point penalty for not having it implemented. I left some recipes in the table, feel free to edit, delete or add more for testing purposes.

To be transperent I did not deploy to vercel from this repository, since Vercel requires a pro plan to deploy from an organization I cloned my repo to a new one and deployed from there. The code is identical except for this readme which I am editing directly on github.
